You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) although YET would update the Applicable Exchange Rate on a regular basis, it would not update such rate on a real-time basis; and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate. For the avoidance of doubt, YET would retain any profits (and will bear any losses) that result from such currency conversion processing due to changes in the applicable foreign exchange rate.</p><p></p>

    <p>Certain products of services the Tour Operator, may require you to provide a higher deposit of make full payment at the time of booking. The Tour Operator will advise you of any such requirements prior to confirmation of the applicable booking.</p>

    <p>YET will collect the deposit and/or the total cost at the time of booking confirmation. The Balance of Payment (defined as the Total Cost minus the deposit) will be payable directly based on the Payment Terms as stated by YET on the booking page.</p>

    <p>The deposit displayed on the booking reference page is generally based on YET Terms as outlined on the booking reference page. Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Tour Cost.</p>

    <p>If you cancel your booking, and that cancellation is not a result of nonpayment or any other breach of these Terms, the deposit amount will be held as a “Lifetime Deposit” with YET, subject to these Terms. Lifetime Deposits have no expiry and may be applied towards payment of a deposit on any other Tour offered by YET. The Lifetime Deposit is transferable and may be transferred by you to another individual of your choosing by providing notice to the Tour Operator in writing.</p>

    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, only the deposit amount will form part of the Lifetime Deposit. The Lifetime Deposit has no cash value. Only one Lifetime Deposit may be applied per person per product booked. A Lifetime Deposit must be applied to a new Tour booking that is of equal or greater value to the cancelled Tour for which the Lifetime Deposit was originally received. A Lifetime Deposit may not be applied to the same or similar dates of travel.</p><p></p>

If YET makes a Material Change (defined as a change affecting at least one in three full tour days of the itinerary, or which materially affects the character of the Product in its entirety) to any Product, YET will inform the Client(s) booked on such Product of any Material Change as soon as reasonably possible, provided that there is sufficient time before departure to properly notify all affected Clients. If a Material Change is made more than 14 days prior to departure, the affected Client may elect to:</p>

    <p>a) accept the Material Change and proceed with the amended Cruise Product;<br>
    b) book another Product of equivalent or greater value, if available (Client shall be responsible for paying any difference in price between the amended Product and the Product booked in its place);<br>
    c) book another Product of a lower value, if available, with a refund payable to the Client of the difference in price; or<br>
    d) cancel and receive a full refund of all monies paid in respect of the land-only portion of the applicable Product (and for clarity, this shall not extend to additional Products booked by the same Client which are not subject to any Material Change).</p>

    <p>The affected Client must notify YET of their decision in writing or via their travel agent within 7 days of receiving the notification of alteration, or they shall have been deemed to accept the Material Change and deemed to have agreed to the amended Product itinerary.</p>

    <p>If any Material Change arises from reasons of Force Majeure, as hereinafter defined, the Client shall be entitled to recover only the costs of the Product recoverable by YET.</p>

    <p>Once a Product tour has departed, changes to such Product’s itinerary may be necessary or advisable as a result of unforeseen circumstances or other reasons related to effective Product operation, health, safety, Client enjoyment, or Client comfort. YET will make suitable alternative arrangements, at no extra cost to the Client, for the continuation of the Product tour and will, where appropriate, compensate the Client for the difference between the services to be supplied under the contract and those supplied. If YET is unable to make arrangements as described above for reasons other than the refusal of the Client to accept such arrangements, YET will, where appropriate, provide the Client with equivalent transport back to the Client’s place of departure or to another place to which the Client and YET have mutually agreed. Any such changes are at the discretion of the YET Tour Leader and any indirect costs incurred as a result will be the responsibility of the Client. The Client acknowledges that they must have reasonable financial resources to cover incidental expenses on every Product on which they travel, whether or not they arise from a change in the itinerary or from the travel itself, and that YET shall not be liable for any Client’s failure to prepare adequately for their travel and unforeseen circumstances which may arise during such travel.</p>

    <p>YET will not be liable for any indirect and or consequential losses associated with any changes to a Product’s itinerary.</p>

    <p><strong>Changes made by the Client:</strong> Client may contact YET directly by telephone, or their booking agent, to correct any errors in Client’s personal information recorded on their booking. Client is responsible for ensuring that information provided to YET in making their booking is accurate, up-to-date, and correct. A transfer from one Product tour to another may only be made 2 days or more prior to departure of the applicable Product, (and more than 7 days prior to departure for Tour Packages) and such transfer must be approved by YET. If such a request is accepted by YET, YET reserves the right to charge up to the deposit amount of the first booked tour. Any request to transfer received less than 1 day, (3 days for Tour Packages) before departure will not be accepted. In this case the Client must cancel the Product booking in accordance with the cancellation terms herein and create a new booking for any other Products. The Client may only transfer a booking to a departure date in the same calendar year and may not transfer a booking to future calendar years. Any changes to the travelling Client’s name on any Product booking are subject to YET’ approval and applicable Administrative Fees may apply, which will be payable by the Client.</p>

    <p>Where the Client is prevented through reasons completed beyond such Client’s control from proceeding with a Product tour as booked the Client may, if possible, transfer his/her Product booking to a person who satisfies all the conditions applicable to the Product tour, provided that the Client gives notice to YET of Client’s intention to transfer no less than 7 days before the date when departure is due to take place. Where such a transfer is made, the transferring Client and the transferee Client shall be jointly and severally liable to YET for payment of the price of the Product (or, if part of the price has been paid, for payment of the balance) and for any additional costs arising from such transfer.</p>

    <p><strong>Other Changes:</strong> Any changes to a file will depend on availability and will be on a request basis and subject to YET’ approval. Any extra costs incurred for making the change will be charged to the Client along with an Administrative Fee.

    <p>You acknowledge that the degree and nature of personal risk involved depends on the products or services booked and the location(s) in which a product or service operates, and that there may be a significant degree of personal risk involved in participating, particularly participating in physical activities, travel to remote locations, carriage by watercraft, participation in “extreme sports” or other high-risk activities, or travel to areas with developing infrastructure. Standards of hygiene, accommodation and transport in certain areas where Tours take place are often lower than the standards you may reasonably expect in your home country or region. You agree that YET is not responsible for providing information or guidance with respect to local customs, weather conditions, specific safety concerns, physical challenges or laws in effect in any locations where a Tour, product or service is operated. You acknowledge you have considered the potential risks, dangers and challenges and your own personal capabilities and needs, and you expressly assume the risks associated with travel under such conditions.</p>

    <p>You must at all times strictly comply with all applicable laws and regulations of all countries and regions. Should you fail to comply with the above or commit any illegal act when on Tour or, if in the opinion of YET (acting reasonably), your behavior is causing or is likely to cause danger, distress or material annoyance to others, YET may terminate your travel arrangements on any product or service immediately at your expense and without any liability on YET’s part. You will not be entitled to any refund for unused or missed services or costs incurred as a result of termination of your travel arrangements, including, without limitation, return travel, accommodations, meals, and incidentals.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for any costs (including repair, replacement and cleaning fees) incurred by YET or YET’s suppliers for property damage, destruction or theft caused by you while on a Tour.

    <p>You agree to take all prudent measures in relation to your own safety while on Tour including, but not limited to, the proper use of safety devices (including seat-belts, harnesses, flotation devices and helmets) and obeying all posted signs and oral or written warnings regarding health and safety. Neither YET nor its Third Party Suppliers (as defined herein) are liable for loss or damages caused by your failure to comply with safety instructions or warnings.</p>

    <p>You agree to bring any complaints to YET as soon as possible in order to provide YET with the opportunity to properly address such complaint. You agree to inform your tour leader, another representative of YET or YET’s customer service department directly. YET assumes no liability for complaints that are not properly brought to the attention of YET and cannot resolve or attempt to resolve complaints until proper notice is provided. Any complaint made after the completion of a Tour must be received in writing by YET within 30 days of the last day of travel of the booking in question.</p><p></p>
